Related packages
================

Here's a list of some related packages. None provide the same functionality
as *npsolve*, but they might be useful for you.
    
* Scipy (Just use the solvers directly)
* Odespy (Class-based models possible, but it looks bit less flexible.)
* Pymunk (2D rigid body motion)
* PyDy (Based on symbolic equations)
* Hamilton (not much documentation?)
* Arboris (robotics)
* Sympy mechanics (a great package, and somewhat object-oriented, but since it
  is symbolic, it will struggle with discontinuities.)
* PyODE (possibly dead?)
* Odelab (Class-based to some degree, but it looks less flexible.)
* Pyndamics (ODE wrapper)
* ARS (Robotics)
